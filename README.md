## General Information

- Boom bike is a bike sharing enterprise in the US that aims to comprehend the various aspects that impact the request for their communal bikes within the American market.

- The completion of the project is a necessity in the Machine Learning module.

- A model that uses multiple linear regression to forecast the usage of bicycles that are shared among people.

- The Boombikes dataset for renting bicycles is currently in use.


## Conclusions
- The R-squared value for the test set is 81.13 percent, while the value for the train set is 82.71 percent. This implies that our model effectively and comprehensively accounts for the differences in the test set. Therefore, we can conclude that the model is satisfactory.	

- The mean squared error of our model that has been created is close to 0 for both the training and testing datasets, indicating that the test set's variance has been predicted accurately. The p-values and VIF were used to select the important variables. An automated selection of variables was performed using RFE.

- The variance of the test set has been accurately predicted because our model's mean squared error is nearly zero for both the training and testing datasets. The significant variables were chosen using the p-values and VIF. RFE was used to automate the selection of variables.

- We utilized EDA, p-value, VIF, and RFE, and employed the statsmodels library for constructing the models.
